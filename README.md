## About

Every great career begins with a single conversation. Yet high-stakes interviews, sales pitches, and professional meetings can feel overwhelmingâ€”especially when you donâ€™t get clear feedback. **Acento.ai** bridges that gap by turning your recorded audio into a roadmap for growth: tone, pacing, filler-word usage, clarity, and confidence.
